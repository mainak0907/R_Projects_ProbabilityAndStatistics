## Introduction: Understanding Data Types; Importing/Exporting Data

Get started with the fundamentals! Learn about different data types, how to import and export data using R, and set the groundwork for the statistical analysis ahead.

## Computing Summary Statistics / Plotting and Visualizing Data

Learn how to compute summary statistics, create insightful visualizations, and effectively convey your data's story using tabulation and graphical representations.

## Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

Explore the concepts of correlation and simple linear regression. Apply these techniques to real datasets, compute the coefficient of determination, and interpret your results.

## Multiple Linear Regression

Take your regression skills to the next level with multiple linear regression. Apply the model to real datasets, compute and interpret multiple coefficients of determination, and gain insights into complex relationships.

## Probability Distributions

Understand and apply key probability distributions including Binomial, Normal, and Poisson distributions, giving you a solid foundation for various statistical analyses.

## Hypothesis Testing - One Sample

Learn hypothesis testing for one sample mean and proportion from real-time problems. Apply tests, analyze results, and make informed conclusions.

## Hypothesis Testing - Two Sample

Expand your hypothesis testing skills to two sample means and proportions from real-time problems. Compare groups, perform tests, and extract meaningful insights.

## t-Test - Independent and Dependent Samples

Master the t-test for independent and dependent samples, crucial techniques for assessing differences between groups and dependencies within data.

## Chi-Squared Test

Learn and apply the Chi-squared test for analyzing categorical data, enabling you to make informed decisions based on observed and expected frequencies.

## Goodness of Fit

Understand and use the goodness of fit test to assess how well an observed frequency distribution fits an expected distribution, enhancing your data analysis capabilities.

## Mini Project - Crime Report Dataset Analysis

Embark on a hands-on mini project! Take a crime report dataset, preprocess the data, and visualize crime rates on a map. Apply your skills to a real-world scenario and gain practical experience.
